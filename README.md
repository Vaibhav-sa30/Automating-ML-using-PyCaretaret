# Automating-ML-using-PyCaretaret

PyCaret helps in building end to end machine learning pipelines.

Earlier we used to spend so much time cleaning the data:
- Removing the outliers
- Transforming the catagorical variables

Then we tend to build the model.

Try out different models to solve the same problem.

Then identify which is the best performing model for the given underlying data.

Followed by picking the best model. 

Identify the hyperparameter 

Then tune them in order to identify the best parameters which fit in

Which improves our expected performance of the model. And THEN we finally save it as a pickle file.



### Most of these tasks that we do it on a regular basis are kind of automated by builtin functions by using this PYCARET LIBRARY.
